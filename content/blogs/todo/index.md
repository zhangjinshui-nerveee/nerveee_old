# Tasks
## Within 72 hours
- [ ] Modify MPS TMS program based on word requirements
- [ ] decide res and cap for deadtime design, (and buy necessary capacitors): capacitors, heatsinks, push button. 
- [ ] BME pre-class video and quiz
- [ ] grade ECE431
## Pool
- Overshooting test of GaN under different resistors
- Post GaN driver debugging record on blog.
- Charging methods sketch
- Modification to MPS
- TA-ECE431 change tutorial solution file name based on 3rd Edtion
- Try TCP/IP labview program
- Calculate rising / falling propagation delay of GaN HEMTs (maybe there is a frequency upper limit?)
- Test all modules current and voltage stress
- PhD exam
- Debug protection board
- Tax statement
- Build an Excel to manage components for a project (general; obtain in / out of stock and prices automaticaly from mouser.com and digikey.com) Write a python program to read links from BOM excel and update price and stock to the form.
