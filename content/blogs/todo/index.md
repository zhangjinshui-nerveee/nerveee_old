# Delayed Gratification
- 2 Papers out of 10 about (Medical) power electronics per week (takes about 3 hours)
- 2 papers out of 5 about TMS and BMI (takes about 3 hours) <br>
>  collect papers during weekdays and read them on Saturday (Print to read, take notes on Tablet)<br>
- A "maker" night where we all work on a random, non-work project.
