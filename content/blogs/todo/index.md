- [x] Interview Lucy [check] 




## Dec 02
- [x] Weekly meeting with Stefan [check]
- [x] Weekly meeting on Moana Project [check]
- [x] Update LabVIEW program, including changing shift register for +- parallel, adding rotation for switching sequence.(maybe I shoudl simulate it with python) 
- [x] Change structure of blog.[check]
  > there should be no project and only blog. The project should never show in this website before closure. 
- [ ] Build a Simulink Model for Moana Project [disposed]


## Dec 01
- [x] Find a way to reduce equivalent switching frequency.[check] 
  > python verification.
- [x] Presentation tomorrow [check]
- [x] DVAM ML. project report [to be continued]
- [x] Make a new version of power modules [Disposed]
  - Compare the rising / falling time between SI8274 and Optical Transmitter
  - How do we obtain frequency limit of GaN 
  > after some research on the chips, it's unnecessary. 
- [x] Forward SSN Memorandum to Mary Pope.
- [x] MPS-TMS files review.[to be conrinued, I should have a objective when reviewing these documents.] 

## Nov 30
- [x] adapt clustering algo and see the difference. [check] 
- [x] Machine learning homework [to be continued]

## Nov 29
- [x] Check Fourier series in DVAM (plot it with histogram) [check]
- [x] Visualize all the vectors in SS pool. [check]
- [x] adapt clustering algo and see the difference.[to be continued] 
- [ ] Update Altium designer file and put to manufacture.[check]

> No matter how much you assign to something, finally you are gonna spend all. So what's the difference if all I need is just the ending? If this thing shall be sustained, the direct difference would be your confidence towards it. If you spend a whole day solving this problem, then you would definitely know you can do it next time you met similar problem. If just one hour is spent on finding some existing answer and understanding it, you don't have the confidence to face it even if you understood it once. <br>
> If this thing is not important, do it quickly, the quicker, the better. But if it means something to you, do it hard-core. Do it differently. Do it for yourself. 

## Nov 28
- [x] Prepare for the discussion about powering MPS-TMS machine up. (Answer all questions.) See details at 7A0.md
  > No Altium projects file. To be continued...
- [x] Debug LabVIEW program (dare we?) [ok] 
  > 1. There is output, but the high-frequency signals for individual modules are intense in specific interval, in other time, it's just low frequency down to 40 kHz. We should spread this density. 
  > 2. With the high frequency signals, the GaN HEMT driver presents a limit. 13MHz it might work (though the current is high up to 3 A), but 40 MHz is just impossible considering hardware design. 
  > 3. Oscilloscope is definitely good enough since we could use it for digital electronics. But the probe lead would be a problem. 
- [x] Review M.L. notes and finish homework 4.1
  > You really shouldn't go back to apt so early. Stay in Library!
