Jinshui received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Tianjin University in 2018. He found friendship there. <br>
He got a Master degree in Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021, major in power electronics. He found ambition there. <br>
Now, he had something crazy enough for him to do --- BRAIN SCIENCE! Use power electronics to build stimulation machines, to discover, to cure, to dream.
