Jinshui received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Tianjin University in 2018. He gained friendship. 

He got a Master degree in Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021, major in power electronics. He gained ambition. 

Now, he has found something crazy enough for him to do --- BRAIN SCIENCE! We can use power electronics to build stimulation machines, to discover, to cure, to dream.
